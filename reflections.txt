How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing diffrences help us find any error and save time and of course money when we are in a timeline project

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's a good way to stablish the advances or delays of a project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If there is a typo, that's will be saved too and it will afect the version control counter in a bad way. A pro is that files will be saved and can be recovered faster

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google docs is not made for developing projects. The concept in Git is opossite

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git Log
    	We have to clone a repository first, then execute "git log". We will see the changes history of that repository
    Git Diff
    	Git diff Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.
    	It has to be used as follows
    		git diff [options] [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
			git diff [options] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
			git diff [options] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>…​]
			git diff [options] <blob> <blob>
			git diff [options] [--no-index] [--] <path> <path>



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We'll always know what we are doing and what we did in case of any major problem 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to learn how colaboration works. I have never used any CV system before

Reflect: Using History for Efficiency

Now that you've learned about some version control systems, and how they can help you save the history of a file, go add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	As I said earlier, having version hystory stands the opportunity of develop the app in the stimated time, because 		we always would know what we have been changing.
